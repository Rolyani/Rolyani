# Hi, I'm Ian

I'm a systems-oriented software engineer interested in how code, infrastructure, and products behave over time.
I focus less on frameworks and more on architecture, constraints, and trade-offs.

## What I work on
- Microservice-based applications with clear domain boundaries
- Kubernetes and GitOps workflows (homelab → production discipline)
- Backend systems in Go and PHP (Laravel), with pragmatic frontends
- Small, focused products designed to ship and survive contact with reality

## How I think
- Systems fail at the edges, not in the happy path
- Operational simplicity beats theoretical elegance
- If it isn't reproducible, it isn't finished
- Learning is only real when it's exercised in production

## Current focus
- Running production-style workloads on a personal k3s cluster
- Deepening Go fundamentals (interfaces, concurrency, HTTP clients)
- Writing and documenting what I learn as *Lessons in Progress*
